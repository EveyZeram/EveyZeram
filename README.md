### Hi there I'm EvelynðŸ‘‹:rainbow:

#### Few things about me:point_down::

*I'm from Tenerife, Canary Islands but I left my home ten years ago to live in Madrid. I know you are going to say "why? why?*:anguished:*" I'm still working in a good response*:sweat_smile:*. But let me say if this one works, I come to Madrid to study Art History and stay here cause I found a job. Now I'm in the way to be a Full Stack Developer, so excited*:battery:*!! See you in a few month* :exclamation:*.*

#### What I'm learning? :pencil:
*I think it's better summarize it with an image...*
